# BarrelCam
A simple GUI to generate cylindrical cams with single or multiple profiles.
You can learn more about cylindrical cams on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_(mechanism))
With this program you can create profiles using sinusoidal or parabolic laws, and then export the resulting cam in:
CVS, DXF (2D), STEP (3d) 

The program uses python 3.10, and PySide6, for the exporting functions I used:
ezdxf for DXF (https://ezdxf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
CadQuery for STEP (https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)

The idea is based on an example from: Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt (www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html)
